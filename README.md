>:Excel Data Analysis: Tips, Tricks & Cheat Sheet 📊
This repository provides a quick reference for essential Excel data analysis techniques, functions, and shortcuts. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, this guide will help you efficiently clean, analyze, and visualize your data.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Clean data is the foundation of accurate analysis.

1. Remove Duplicates
Easily eliminate redundant rows from your dataset.

How to: Select your data range > Data Tab > Data Tools Group > Remove Duplicates.

2. Text to Columns
Split data from one column into multiple columns based on a delimiter (e.g., comma, space) or fixed width.

How to: Select the column > Data Tab > Data Tools Group > Text to Columns. Follow the wizard steps.

3. Flash Fill ✨
Excel intelligently fills data based on patterns it detects from your first few entries. Super powerful for parsing text!

How to: Start typing your desired output in the next column. After a few entries, Excel should suggest filling the rest. Press Enter, or go to Data Tab > Data Tools Group > Flash Fill.

4. Trim Spaces
Remove extra spaces from text, leaving only single spaces between words and no leading/trailing spaces.

Formula: TRIM(cell_reference)

Example: =TRIM(A2)

5. Go To Special (Blanks, Constants, Formulas)
A powerful tool for quickly selecting specific types of cells.

How to: Home Tab > Find & Select > Go To Special... (or Ctrl + G, then Alt + S).

Select Blanks to quickly find and fill empty cells.

Select Formulas to highlight all cells containing formulas.

Select Constants to highlight cells with static values.

🧪 Essential Functions
Master these functions for robust data manipulation.

1. Basic Aggregation Functions
SUM(range): Adds up numbers in a range.

AVERAGE(range): Calculates the average of numbers in a range.

COUNT(range): Counts cells containing numbers.

COUNTA(range): Counts non-empty cells.

MAX(range): Finds the largest value.

MIN(range): Finds the smallest value.

2. Logical Functions
IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false): Performs a logical test and returns one value for TRUE, another for FALSE.

Example: =IF(B2>100, "High", "Low")

IFS(logical_test1, value_if_true1, [logical_test2, value_if_true2], ...): Checks multiple conditions and returns the value corresponding to the first true condition.

Example: =IFS(B2>100, "High", B2>50, "Medium", B2<=50, "Low")

3. Conditional Counting & Summing
COUNTIF(range, criteria): Counts cells within a range that meet a single specified condition.

Example: =COUNTIF(C:C, "East")

COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], ...): Counts cells that meet multiple criteria.

Example: =COUNTIFS(C:C, "East", D:D, ">500")

SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range]): Sums cells based on a single condition.

Example: =SUMIF(C:C, "East", B:B)

SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], ...): Sums cells that meet multiple criteria.

Example: =SUMIFS(B:B, C:C, "East", D:D, ">500")

AVERAGEIF / AVERAGEIFS: Similar to SUMIF / SUMIFS but calculates averages.

4. Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH)
Crucial for retrieving specific data.

VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup]): Looks for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.

range_lookup: TRUE (approximate match, default) or FALSE (exact match, recommended).

Example: =VLOOKUP("Apple", A2:C10, 2, FALSE)

HLOOKUP(...): Similar to VLOOKUP, but looks horizontally (by row).

XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]): (Modern Excel) A more flexible and powerful replacement for VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP.

Example: =XLOOKUP("Product A", A:A, B:B, "Not Found")

INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num]) & MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type]): Often used together for two-way lookups and more flexibility than VLOOKUP.

MATCH returns the position of a value in a range. match_type: 0 (exact match).

INDEX returns the value at a specified intersection of a row and column within a range.

Example: =INDEX(B:B, MATCH("Product A", A:A, 0))

5. Text Manipulation Functions
TEXT(value, format_text): Converts a value to text with a specific format.

Example: =TEXT(A2, "dd-mm-yyyy")

CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...) or text1 & text2: Joins several text strings into one.

Example: =CONCATENATE(A2, " ", B2) or =A2 & " " & B2

LEFT(text, [num_chars]): Extracts characters from the beginning of a text string.

RIGHT(text, [num_chars]): Extracts characters from the end of a text string.

MID(text, start_num, num_chars): Extracts characters from the middle of a text string.

LEN(text): Returns the number of characters in a text string.

FIND(find_text, within_text, [start_num]): Finds one text value within another (case-sensitive). Returns starting position.

SEARCH(find_text, within_text, [start_num]): Finds one text value within another (not case-sensitive). Returns starting position.

🛠️ Data Analysis Tools
Leverage Excel's built-in features for deeper insights.

1. PivotTables
The ultimate tool for summarizing, analyzing, exploring, and presenting your data.

How to: Select your data > Insert Tab > Tables Group > PivotTable. Drag fields to Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters areas.

2. Data Validation
Control the type of data or values users can enter into a cell. Prevents errors.

How to: Select cell(s) > Data Tab > Data Tools Group > Data Validation. Choose criteria (List, Whole Number, Date, etc.).

3. Conditional Formatting
Visually highlight cells based on their values, making patterns and trends stand out.

How to: Select range > Home Tab > Styles Group > Conditional Formatting. Explore Highlight Cells Rules, Top/Bottom Rules, Data Bars, Color Scales, Icon Sets.

4. Sort & Filter

How to: Select data > Data Tab > Sort & Filter Group > Sort or Filter.

5. Subtotals
Quickly group your data and calculate subtotals (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, etc.) for each group.

Prerequisite: Data must be sorted by the column you want to subtotal by.

How to: Select data > Data Tab > Outline Group > Subtotal.

6. What-If Analysis
Tools to test how changes in values affect formulas.

How to: Data Tab > Forecast Group > What-If Analysis.

Goal Seek: Finds the input value needed to achieve a desired result.

Scenario Manager: Create and save different groups of input values (scenarios) to see how they affect results.

Data Table: Shows how changing one or two input variables in a formula will affect the formula's results.

7. Solver (Add-in)
An Excel add-in used for optimization problems, finding the best (maximum or minimum) value for a formula subject to constraints.
